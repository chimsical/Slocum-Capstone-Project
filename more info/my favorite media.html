    <h1>Charlotte's Favorite Media</h1>
    <p>A good majority of the following examples fall into the horror genre, and some are not-safe-for-work. Despite this, I enjoy them deeply for their artistic value.</p>
    <h2>Films:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"ParaNorman", 2012
            <p>Stop-motion animation is my favorite artistic medium for story-telling, and "ParaNorman" is one of the best examples of it. This movie is the first ever stop motion film to use full-color 3-D printers, which are now instrumental in a lot of big-budget stop-motion puppet making, like "Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio" 2022.</p>
        </li>
        <li>"Hereditary", 2018
            <p>This movie solidified Ari Aster as one of my favorite filmmakers; he writes and directs all of his films (my ideal future career!). "Hereditary" is a great example of a horror film where the horror can be interpreted as being both literal and symbolic - are the demons that haunt this family real, or is the way each family member is affected by the demonic presence a visual representation of the way they are affected by their grief?</p>
        </li>
        <li>"Suspiria", 2018
            <p>I generally hate remakes of classic movies, but this version of "Suspira" is more of a homage to the original film. Compared to the brightly colored setting of the original, this film provided the artistic aspect through the contemporary ballet sequences, and was genuinely horrifying overall. I do also enjoy the original "Suspira" from 1977, but for much different reasons.<p>
        </li>
        <li>Special Mention - "Opal", short film by Jack Stauber, 2020
            <p>An absolutely incredible mixed-media stop-motion film with a story that haunts me, all in 13 minutes.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
